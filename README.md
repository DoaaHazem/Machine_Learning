# Hotel_Booking_Cancelation_Prediction
## Project Overview
#### This project is a classification problem , aims to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. Using the Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction dataset, I performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis,  visualization and applied machine learning models to achieve a high predictive accuracy.

## Project Motivation
#### The hospitality industry often faces cancellations, which can affect revenue management. This project seeks to use machine learning to predict cancellations, enabling proactive strategies to minimize losses.
## Data Preprocessing
#### - Handled missing values in the dataset.
#### - Handled duplicated rows in the dataset.
#### - Handled datatype of features in the dataset.
#### - Handled outliers in the dataset.
#### - Transformed categorical features into numerical format.
#### - Performed feature scaling to normalize the data.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Visualization techniques were used to better understand the data, including:
#### - Distribution of canceled vs. non-canceled bookings.
#### - Analysis of key features affecting cancellation rates (e.g., lead time, room type).
#### - Average Cancellation Rate.
#### - Peak Cancellation Months.
#### - Most Common Cancellation Reason.
#### - Correlation Between Features.
## Modeling
#### I used the Random Forest Classifier for this task. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model achieved 88% accuracy on the test set. The Random Forest model was selected for its ability to handle large datasets with high-dimensional features.
## Results
#### Model accuracy: 88%
#### Precision, Recall, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate model performance in predicting cancellations.
## Conclusion
#### The model performs well in predicting hotel booking cancellations, providing a useful tool for hotels to manage bookings more effectively.
